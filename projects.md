In this page there are examples of machine learning projects and
predictive models that I worked with during my career in different
companies.

# Voicedoubles

**WIP**

Voice similarity search engine (text-independent) robust to noise, music,
reverberation and language. This project was based on academic papers an reached
state of the art in speaker. The engine is DNN model and also utilizes
Embeddings developed in kaldi and python scikit-learning.


# Speaker recognition

Automatic speaker recognition project aims to recognize individual
people (verification task) in a data base from their voices. I worked
on the machine learning and also on the preprocessing voice separation
algorithms. The figures bellow illustrates the input audio where there
are two channels. One channel is called remote channel and it has the
voice of the local operator and the voice of the speaker that we are
interested. The other channel called local channel has only voice of
the operator.  I developed an algorithm to extract the operators voice
of the remote channel and remove silence on this channel. The
algorithm utilizes the autocorrelation properties of random signal in
order to perform this task.

The figure bellows shows the expected output.

Pre-processed output
</audio>

The **MFCC** (Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients) features was
extract from the preprocessed audio. A **Bayesian classifier** was
built with a **GMM** (Gaussian Mixture Models) and these features.

Although the algorithm works for independent text verification, a high
performance was reached with prompt text, where the speakers answer
questions asked to them by one operator. The performance of 95% (TPR =
TNR = 0.95) was achieved when the speaker utilizes the same physical
audio system that he/she used during the enrollment phase where its
model was trained. One of the major challenges of this project are the
fact that different microphones, noise, channel transmission and
environment change the speech signature of the speaker and therefore
make harder to verify the identity of the speaker. Under this
situation, the performance dropped to 90%, but in this situation only
the voices of 3 different speakers were used to measure this
performance and more data is necessary to assess the quality of the
algorithms under this situation.


# Crop Recognition and Crop date determination

Crop Recognition and Automatic Determination of the Planting Date
project (developed in **IDL**) which analyzes satellite images in
order to determine planting dates and the crop type planted in the
producing regions.

Below is an example of the output of the classifier running in a public data.

# Wrinkle Analysis

I developed an image processing algorithm (**C, OpenCv**)to extract
facial wrinkles. A score was attributed to the wrinkles and these data
were correlated with medical data in order to determine skin age.

It was a marketing project that was being developed for a cosmetic
company to recommend products to their clients based on their skin
age.

# Magnetic noise attenuation system


Magnetic noise attenuation system: In this project, I designed a
compensation coil in order to reduce magnetic noise in magnetic
resonance scanner room. Also, I worked on the implementation of the
attenuation algorithm (C) deployed in **DSPIC**.

# RAoP

In this project data from online community Random Act of Pizza
([RAoP](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/)) forum was
analyzed. The data is a collection of post where reddit's users are
requesting free pizza. Sentimental analyses were performed in the data
and the findings were used to build a model to predict if the post
written by the user will be successful. The link for the analysis can
be found
[here](https://github.com/leandroohf/raop/blob/master/README.md) and a
better explanation with more detail can be found in the links below.

# Kaggle Liberty

First Kaggle competition. The task is to predict a transformed count
of hazards or pre-existing damages using a dataset with anonymized
data.  I wrote a report explaining my journey (steps)
[here](https://github.com/leandroohf/Public_Liberty_Mutual_Group_Property_Inspection_Prediction)
    
# Virtual Eye (VEye)

Project developed during my MSc. I developed a computational framework
in C++ capable to reproduce the optical properties and physiological
phenomena of the human visual system. To accomplish that, I worked by
manipulating 3d meshes implementing algorithms such as **"door-in
door-out"**, developed realistic ray traces algorithms and schematics
models of the human eye was built and in addition in-vivo data
obtained from corneal topography machine was introduced in these
models allowing the framework to determine optical properties of real
cornea's topologies such as dioptric power, high order aberrations
using **Zernike’s polynomials** and Point spread function (**PSF**)
using **Fourier transform**. The obtained results agree with related
work in literature and simulations with in-vivo data are according
with the results produced by a commercial wave-front device.

You can find my thesis
[here.](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/55/55134/tde-09052008-161636/en.php)

The images below is indeed a VEye's simulation where ray trace
algorithm is used to form a retinal image of the object in the scene
(Lena's image) in the Gullstrand-LeGrand schematic eye model.

The next picture is the image formed in the retina of the schematic
eye model where the in-vivo cornea has **ceratocone** and health
cornea. The orientation of the images was corrected for better
visualization since the real image is inverted in the retina.
